# Dynamic Programming: Markov Decision Process

This repository contains the implementation of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using dynamic programming techniques. The project models decision-making scenarios with probabilistic outcomes and optimizes strategies using policy iteration.

## Features
- Multi-state MDP simulation
- State transition and reward functions
- Policy iteration algorithm to compute optimal strategies
- Implemented in Python with NumPy for efficient computation
